        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Northwest Samar State University, Calbayog City</li>
            <li>Diploma in Computer System and Services at Buenavista Senior High School, San Jorge, Samar</li>
            <li>Diploma at Balud Elementary Sta. Margarita, Samar</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My Educational Journey:</p>
        <p>My educational journey has involved transferring to every school since I was in elementary school until I started high school. Because of this, I met different people who became my friends and enemies. It's also the reason why the content of my artworks focuses more on experiencesâ€”the happy memories and the sad events. But being known to draw, I was inspired to use a pencil or brush to make art because my number one coach who taught me is my father. I love to draw, especially painting. I love to see myself with different paints on my hands and clothes. It satisfies me. It is also my therapy. Even though I didn't have enough achievements to show my talents and because I'm an introvert, being in love with the arts, in college I wanted to study and pursue a program related to the arts. But sad to say, my IQ didn't reach the expected average to get that program. So, I chose the program that I also think I like, which is Information Technology. Being an I.T. student is so difficult, but I think I can manage. I'm hoping someday I'll be given the opportunity to pursue my dream program.</p>
